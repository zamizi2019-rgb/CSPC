PW2 Lab B Part 4 -- chemical equilibrium via the equilibrium constant K.

Reaction  H2 + I2 <=> 2 HI, starting from 1 mol H2 and 1 mol I2.
As the reaction proceeds by an extent x:  H2 = 1-x,  I2 = 1-x,  HI = 2x.
At equilibrium the composition satisfies the equilibrium constant
        K = [HI]^2 / ([H2][I2]) = (2x)^2 / ((1-x)(1-x)).
Given K, find the extent x. Solve it TWO ways and compare.
Run:  python equilibrium.py

# TODO 1: write k_imbalance(x) = (2x)^2/((a-x)(b-x)) - K.
#         It equals zero exactly at equilibrium.

# TODO 2 (method 1): use scipy.optimize.newton to find the root of k_imbalance
#         (start x0=0.5). This is root-finding.

# TODO 3 (method 2): use scipy.optimize.minimize to minimise k_imbalance(x)**2
#         (method "SLSQP", bounds [(0, 0.999)], x0=[0.5]). Print both answers
#         and confirm they agree.

# TODO 4: report the equilibrium amounts (H2, I2, HI), and plot how the three
#         amounts change with the extent x, marking the equilibrium. Save
#         equilibrium.png.
